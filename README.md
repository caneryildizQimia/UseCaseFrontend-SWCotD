# VHH Case Studies

This Monorepo containing two distinct projects: a Next.js application and a FastAPI-based API. This repository is structured to provide an integrated view of these two projects, each serving different purposes.

## Projects

### 1. Star Wars Character of the Day (Next.js Application)

This project is a **Next.js** application that showcases a "Star Wars Character of the Day" using data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI).

2. Follow the [Next.js README](./nextjs-project/README.md) for setup and usage instructions.

### 2. Air Pollution Statistics API (FastAPI)

This project is a **FastAPI**-based API designed to provide various endpoints for retrieving air pollution-related statistics.

**Features:**
- **Endpoints for Statistics:** Provides data such as averages, medians, and standard deviations for air pollution over specified time ranges.
- **Geographical Scope:** Includes statistics for countries and continents.

**Getting Started:**
1. Navigate to the [FastAPI project](./fastapi-project) directory.
